The Revolution mod brings Radar to Needlefish, ECM to aircraft and introduces a more immersive fog-of-war for island captures.

The mod is based on UI Enhancer and Albatross AWACS, so you get those amazing benefits included.

[h2]ECM[/h2]

Aircraft can now equip an ECM Mission Pod on wing hardpoints. In addition to 1000l of fuel, these pods provide Radar jamming and spoofing
capability.  When fitted they will reduce the distance where a hostile Radar will pick up the aircraft.  If fitted to an AWACS, the pod will
the enemy Radar to see multiple ghost contacts.

ECM reduces the contact range to about 8km from the carrier, AWACS or ground based radars.

[h2]Enhanced Radar Simulations[/h2]

[list]
[*] AWACS Radar now has increased range if you fly above 1600m, up to a max of 12km.
[*] Radar ground clutter/wave height is now considered when tracking low level aircraft in operator screens.
[*] Flying at below ~40-50m you can try sneak in under your opponent's Radar.
[*] It is also harder to detect aircraft flying low over very rough sea.
[*] CIWS Needlefish can detect hostile aircraft at 5km
[*] Torpedo Needlefish can detect ships at 3.5km
[*] Cruise Missile Needlefish can detect ships at 6km
[*] Gun Needlefish can detect ships at 2km
[*] All Needlefish can see ships and aircraft that are closer than 0.5km.
[/list]

[h2]Fog of War[/h2]

The color (team) of a hostile island will be hidden until you bring a unit within range of that island. No more will capturing an AI controlled 
island give away your position 100km away.

[h2]Markers[/h2]

You can now add markers to the game map to help your team plan and keep track of information and objectives.  Place up
to 4 point markers on the map that will be viewable by all your crew on operator screen terminals or holomaps.

Please note, the markers are still experimental, they may not work correctly in large games and may flash annoyingly at first.

[h2]Holomap Quick Select[/h2]

The holomap now has an expandable menu that can be used to select and zoom to friendly aircraft. Useful if your
captain is acting as GCI to select the aircraft of a player needing guidance.

[h2]Aircraft Cam and Petrel Orders[/h2]

For aircraft, if you click one on the holomap, you can now see an
extra menu, clicking Camera will show a low-res version of the aircraft
flight camera

If you click a Petrel, you will be able to click the Airlift button to
order it to pickup the nearest friendly ground unit within 700m

If the petrel is carrying cargo already, you will be able to click to deploy
the unit at the petrel's current location.

[h2]General Atmosphere/Gameplay[/h2]

[list]
[*] If a unit you are controlling takes a significant amount of damage (about 20%) in one hit, you will see visual interference in your HUD camera feed for a second
[/list]

[h2]Barge Cap[/h2]

[list]
[*] Barge islands now serve as control nodes for your barges, each island lets you control two extra barges (plus a base two to start with)
[*] Barge camera (HUD) video streams can be jammed by enemy carriers. If your barge gets very close (<200m) to a hostile carrier, you will get increasingly more signal degredation until your video drops out.
[/list]

(In my opinion) the barge is either too cheap or too tough (1 Cruise Missile Needlefish vs 11 Barges) - 11 Barges require 55
heavy bombs to kill - it isn't well balanced for long games with many players (more barges/fish = more lag in big games) so Revolution
caps the number of barges

For exmaple:
If your team has 2 carriers, and you control 2 barge islands, you will be able to build a maximum of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 barges.
If your team has 1 carrier, and one barge island, you'll be able to build no more than 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 total barges.

If you lose an island or carrier, your barges won't go away, you just won't be able to build more than the cap for what you have.

[h2]General Info[/h2]

This is merged with 2 other mods:

Albatross AWACS swaps the AWACS-carrying capability from the Manta to the Albatross - By Thumblegudget
Also includes UI enhancer - By QuantX

[h2]Credits[/h2]

Thank-you to QuantX for UI Enhancer. And to Mr Scoot for showing how deep you can dive with modding CC2.

Thanks also to Kazzik, CylindricalBobcat, Thumblegudget, Pointclearius and Delta Fleet for help testing the mod.
