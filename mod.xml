The Revolution mod brings Radar enhancements, a more immersive fog-of-war for island captures and
other enhancements.

* Fog of war
* Bomb enemy factories (disabled by default)
* Needlefish rebalance (reduced simulated Radar range)
* AWACS rebalance (~10-12km max range again for a better feel)
* Manta rebalance (less deadly against carriers for more air combat)
* Aircraft RWR sensor
* Bomb enemy factories to slow production

The mod is based on UI Enhancer and Albatross AWACS, so you get those amazing benefits included.
